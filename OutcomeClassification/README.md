# Outcome Variables 
The number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population was 
calculated, using the accumulated COVID-19 case data published on May 19, 2020. The 
resultant county-level case, plotted in Figure S2, shows a pattern that is intriguing, 
discrete, and widespread (mean ± s.d., 268.6 ± 541.7), indicating that the causes leading 
to a heterogeneous infection is a classification problem. In addition, most of the high 
cases (>500) are clustered geographically, forming small patches in the color code map, 
revealing that some geographic features and the associated demographic variables may 
comprise the leading factor. In this article, I used the cutoff at 90th percentile of the COVID
19 cases (i.e., 600) and stratified the counties into heavily infected (≥ 600, n = 286) and 
mildly infected (< 600, n = 2566).
