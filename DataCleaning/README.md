# Data Cleaning
Among the 15 variable predictors, except missing data which will be described in the following paragraph, 9 were from the original data sources while 6 others were cleaned by a criterion to extract the major factor, the ratios, and the means. For the former 9 variables in which the variable “senior population” used the percent of county population who were aged 65 years and over, the level of “education” was the percent of adults obtaining a bachelor’s degree or higher in 2014-2018, and the “party preference” was applied from the results of 2016 presidential election. Next, the following changes were made for the latter 6 variables. For the variable “race”, the data was originally released as the percentage of populations in different races. With such data, a dominant race in each county would be mapped when one particular race was populated more than 50 percent. For the variable “gender”, the form of sex ratio, females to males, was used. In two other air-quality variables, air-ozone pollution and atmospheric PM2.5, an average of the values measured every day in 2014 was calculated. Similarly, a mean of the “daily temperatures” but measured only during the COVID-19 outbreak, January-May in 2020, was also computed. The last variable “effective time of stay-at-home orders” was only available if the counties ever issued the order. The word “never” was placed for those never issued.

# Missing data and Imputation 

After data cleaning, there are a total 2,876 subjects with COVID-19 cases delineated by Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). Unfortunately, some missing values were found in 6 variables, with 5 variables missing less than 23 and one variable missing as high as 288 subjects. Due to a small size, missing subjects in those 5 variables would be removed by a listwise deletion. This led to 2,852 subjects with 10% missing rate in “daily temperatures”. Since temperature is affected by geographic factors, counties neighboring to each other would presumably share a similar level of values. With this logic, k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used to impute the 288 otherwise missing values, based on latitude and longitude of counties.
