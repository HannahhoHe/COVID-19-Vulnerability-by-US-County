Data sources – 
USA Facts, U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Kaggle


There are 9 datasets used in this project. Seven were uploaded to this folder, and 2 others are available from Kaggle: [daily-county-level-pm2.5-concentrations-2001-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/daily-county-level-ozone-and-pm2.5-concentrations/version/27),[daily-county-level-ozone-concentrations-2001-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/daily-county-level-ozone-and-pm2.5-concentrations/version/27).  



# Data Description 
This proposal investigated the factors that contributed to COVID-19 cases distributed geographically on a US county level. With machine-learning approaches, cases per 100,000 population (dependent variable) would be measured against 15 predictors comprising the county’s overall population, senior population, race, gender, education, household income, obesity rates, smoking rates, crime rates, air-ozone pollution, atmospheric PM2.5, daily temperatures as well as psychographic profiles – political party preference, commuter drive-alone rates, and “effective time of stay-at-home orders”. 

# Data Cleaning
Among the 15 variable predictors, except missing data which will be described in the following paragraph, 9 were from the original data sources while 6 others were cleaned by a criterion to extract the major factor, the ratios, and the means. For the former 9 variables, the details are in Table 1, in which the variable “senior population” used the percent of county population who were aged 65 years and over, the level of “education” was the percent of adults obtaining a bachelor’s degree or higher in 2014-2018, and the “party preference” was applied from the results of 2016 presidential election. In Table 2, the following changes were made for the latter 6 variables. For the variable “race”, the data was originally released as the percentage of populations in different races. With such data, a dominant race in each county would be mapped when one particular race was populated more than 50 percent. For the variable “gender”, the form of sex ratio, females to males, was used. In two other air-quality variables, air-ozone pollution and atmospheric PM2.5, an average of the values measured every day in 2014 was calculated. Similarly, a mean of the “daily temperatures” but measured only during the COVID-19 outbreak, January-May in 2020, was also computed. The last variable “effective time of stay-at-home orders” was only available if the counties ever issued the order. The word “never” was placed for those never issued.
