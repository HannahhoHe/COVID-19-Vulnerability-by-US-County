# Data Description 
This proposal investigated the factors that contributed to COVID-19 cases distributed geographically on a US county level. With machine-learning approaches, cases per 100,000 population (dependent variable) would be measured against 15 predictors comprising the county’s overall population, senior population, race, gender, education, household income, obesity rates, smoking rates, crime rates, air-ozone pollution, atmospheric PM2.5, daily temperatures as well as psychographic profiles – political party preference, commuter drive-alone rates, and “effective time of stay-at-home orders”.
